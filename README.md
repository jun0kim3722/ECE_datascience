# Final Project
## Due: 04/30/2023 11:59pm ET

## Note: A crucial aspect of this project involves submitting a part of the project to GRADESCOPE.

Up until now, we have given you fairly detailed instructions for how to design data analyses to answer specific questions about data -- in particular, how to set up a particular analysis and what steps to take to run it. In this project, you will put that knowledge to use!

Put yourself in the shoes of a data scientist being given a data set and asked to draw conclusions from it. Your job will be to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense.

We are deliberately not giving you detailed directions on how to solve these problems, but feel free to come to office hours to brainstorm.

## Objectives

There are three possible paths through this project:

1. You may use data set #1, which captures information about student behavior and performance in an online course. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
2. You may use data set #2, which captures information about bike usage in New York City. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
3. You may use data set #3, which are images of digits. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.

## Partners

On this project **you may work with one partner** (from the same section). Working with a partner is optional, and working with a partner will not impact how the project is graded. If you want to work with a partner, it is your responsibility to pair up; feel free to use Piazza's "Search for Teammates" feature (https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48001158117-search-for-teammates) to facilitate this.

If you are working with a partner. This means that only one of the team lead (one of the two members), will have to submit the completed code (on GitHub) and the PDF report (on GitHub and Gradescope). 

Moreover, to collaboratively work on this project the team-lead could add the other member as a collaborator to his/her repository. You can check the following link on how to add collaborators to your repository
 https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

Important Points:

1. The group leader will be in charge of pushing the last version of the project to his/her repository. 

2. If you choose to work alone, you will be in charge of your own project and act as the leader of your own group.

3. The version on the leader's GitHub account will be used for grading. 

4. The people who will lead their teams (including those who will work alone) are asked to fill out a form to provide information about their team. Here's the link to the form: https://forms.gle/ytT2u8eGukddJ9XA9 .

## Path 2: Bike traffic

The `NYC_Bicycle_Counts_2016_Corrected.csv` gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict what *day* (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

## What to turn in
You must turn in two sets of files, by pushing them to your team leader's Github repository. For the report PDF, it has to be submitted to **Gradescope** as well:

* `report.pdf`: A project report, which should consist of:
  * A section with the names of the team members (maximum of two), your Purdue username(s), and the path (1 or 2 or 3) you have taken.
  * A section describing the dataset you are working with.
  * A section describing the analyses you chose to use for each analysis question (with a paragraph or two justifying why you chose that analysis and what you expect the analysis to tell you).
  * A section (or more) describing the results of each analysis, and what your answers to the questions are based on your results. Visual aids are helpful here, if necessary to back up your conclusions. Note that it is OK if you do not get "positive" answers from your analysis, but you must explain why that might be.

* All Python `.py` code files you wrote to complete the analysis steps.#
