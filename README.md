# Final Project
## Due: 04/30/2023 11:59pm ET

## Note: A crucial aspect of this project involves submitting a part of the project to GRADESCOPE.

Up until now, we have given you fairly detailed instructions for how to design data analyses to answer specific questions about data -- in particular, how to set up a particular analysis and what steps to take to run it. In this project, you will put that knowledge to use!

Put yourself in the shoes of a data scientist being given a data set and asked to draw conclusions from it. Your job will be to understand what the data is showing you, design the analyses you need, justify those choices, draw conclusions from running the analyses, and explain why they do (or do not) make sense.

We are deliberately not giving you detailed directions on how to solve these problems, but feel free to come to office hours to brainstorm.

## Objectives

There are three possible paths through this project:

1. You may use data set #1, which captures information about student behavior and performance in an online course. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
2. You may use data set #2, which captures information about bike usage in New York City. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.
3. You may use data set #3, which are images of digits. See below for the analysis questions we want you to answer.

## Path2: Bike traffic

The `NYC_Bicycle_Counts_2016_Corrected.csv` gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day? 
3. Can you use this data to predict what *day* (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?
